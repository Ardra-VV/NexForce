Height and Weight Data Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing a dataset of heights and weights, calculating key descriptive statistics like median, mode, and mean.

Code Structure
The code is written in Python using the Pandas library:
-Imports the Pandas library.
-Reads the dataset from the specified path.
-Calculates and prints the median, mode, and mean for both height and weight.

Future Work
-Visualizations: Create visualizations to explore the distribution of height and weight data.
-Correlation Analysis: Examine the relationship between height and weight.
-Outlier Detection: Identify and handle potential outliers in the data.
-Further Statistical Analysis: Conduct additional statistical tests to uncover insights and patterns.

Libraries Used
-Pandas
